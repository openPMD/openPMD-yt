openPMD frontend for yt-project.org (Draft)
===========================================

### TL;DR

**If you are looking for the official yt-project repository**,
here is the official link to their bitbucket:

  https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/yt/


### This Repository

This is a **draft** of a HDF5 reader implementation for
[openPMD](http://openPMD.org) in [yt-project.org](http://yt-project.org/)

Some sizes are still fixed to our example data sets and particlePatch
supports needs to be added for parallel data processing.

If you are a python hacker, you might enjoy the current draft and feel
free to contribute :)

The files for new reader implementations are in
 - [yt/frontends/openPMD](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-yt/tree/dev-1.0.0/yt/frontends/openPMD)

and examples are stored in our repo
 - [openPMD/openPMD-yt-examples](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-yt-examples)
